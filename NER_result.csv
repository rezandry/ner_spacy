"1","17284","Rift Between Officers and Residents as Killings Persist in South Bronx - The New York Times","New York Times","Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker","2017-06-19","2017.0","6.0","","After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South <Location>Bronx<Location>, just across the Harlem River from <Location>Manhattan<Location> and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of <Location><Location>New York<Location> City<Location>. And yet the city’s efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>, at the southern tip of the <Location>Bronx<Location>, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the city’s 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside <Location>Manhattan<Location>, according to a <Organization><Location>New York<Location> <Organization>Times<Organization><Organization> analysis of <Organization>Police Department<Organization> data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to <Organization>Police Headquarters<Organization> to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the <Location>Bronx<Location>, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the city’s five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The borough’s robbery squad is smaller than <Location>Manhattan<Location>’s, even though the <Location>Bronx<Location> has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper <Location>Manhattan<Location> and more than one detective per murder in Lower <Location>Manhattan<Location>. In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors, more fearful of a gunman’s crew than confident in the <Organization>Police Department<Organization>’s ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South <Location>Bronx<Location>, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in <Location>the United States<Location>, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the caller’s arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. <Person>Gola White<Person>, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in <Location>Bronx<Location> neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. “Here, we have nothing,” she said. When it comes to “  families,” she said, the authorities “don’t really care as much. That’s how I feel. ” The <Organization>Times<Organization> has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in <Location><Location>New York<Location> City<Location>. The homicides  —   14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015  —   strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers’ view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives’ phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victim’s friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mother’s apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews’ threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Mary’s Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> this year. Both are unsolved. <Person>James Fernandez<Person> heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the <Organization>Bloods<Organization> gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of <Location>New York<Location>, still rattles the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, <Organization>Police Service Area 7<Organization>, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. “There’s a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you,” a sergeant’s police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, “I’m going to shoot through your window. ” Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers’ names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, “then said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me,” Mr. Fernandez’s wife, <Person>Maria Fernandez<Person>, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to “slap” her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because “they are the ones snitching,” her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the <Location>New York<Location> of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precinct’s residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. <Person>Michael J. LoPuzzo<Person> walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> station house. The cases that land on his metal desk  —   dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves  —   bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the city’s   campaign. “I haven’t got one single phone call that’s putting me in the right direction here,” said <Person>Sergeant LoPuzzo<Person>, the head of the precinct’s detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victim’s aunt about why the killer had not been caught. “And people just don’t understand that. ” Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the <Location>Bronx<Location> through early September, more than a third  —   66 victims  —   refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor <Person>Michael R. Bloomberg<Person> and his police commissioner, <Person>Raymond W. Kelly<Person>. Near the height of the    strategy, in 2012, the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> had the   stops in the city, the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. “I need to bring something in today to justify my existence,” Officer <Person>Argenis Rosado<Person>, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. “So now you’re in a small area, and day after day you’re hammering the same community. Of course that community’s eventually going to turn on you. ” The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. “Some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too,” said <Person>Hector Espada<Person>, a   veteran of the precinct. “Not because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you can’t give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that. ” <Person>Morale<Person> wilted in the aged station house on <Person>Alexander Avenue<Person>, in <Location>Mott Haven<Location>. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be “ticket fixing,” or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like   that put them in   situations on the street. “Whenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud,” said <Person>Russell Lewis<Person>, a    of the 40th. “It was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didn’t want to get caught up in anything. ” The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the <Organization>Police Department<Organization> has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift  —   a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, <Person>James P. <Person>O’Neill<Person><Person>, said he was handling in a similar South <Location>Bronx<Location> precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector <Person>Brian Hennessy<Person>. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. <Person>O’Neill<Person> and Mayor <Person>Bill de Blasio<Person> to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to people’s concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. “That perception really sticks,” he said. The workload in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in <Location>Manhattan<Location> compared with the <Location>Bronx<Location>, <Location>Brooklyn<Location> and <Location>Queens<Location>. Three of the precinct’s 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through    —   murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of <Location>Washington Heights<Location> handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the <Location>Bronx<Location> as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in <Location>Manhattan<Location>, 37 in <Location>Brooklyn<Location>, 38 in <Location>Queens<Location> and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. <Organization>Precinct<Organization>s in much of <Location>Manhattan<Location>, which are whiter and wealthier than the South <Location>Bronx<Location>, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. <Person>Michael Palladino<Person>, the head of <Organization>the Detectives’ Endowment Association<Organization> and a former <Location>Bronx<Location> officer, said staffing disparities affected the department’s efforts to build trust in communities like the South <Location>Bronx<Location>. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: “If I cooperate with the detectives, there’s so much work, there’s so few of them there, they won’t even get the chance to protect me, or they’ll be there too late when the retaliation comes. ” <Person>Sergeant LoPuzzo<Person>, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. “We fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had,” he said. Details of how the <Organization>Police Department<Organization> assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in <Location>flux<Location>, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The <Organization>Times<Organization>’s analysis of confidential staffing data, the department’s chief of detectives, <Person>Robert K. <Person>Boyce<Person><Person>, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief <Person>Boyce<Person> said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precinct’s detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from <Organization>the City Council<Organization> through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the city’s last “” the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the <Organization>Police Department<Organization> should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in <Location>Manhattan<Location>. “Any crime in <Location>Manhattan<Location> has to be solved,” said <Person>Howard Landesberg<Person>, who was a 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> detective in the late 1980s. “The outer boroughs are, like, forgotten. ” Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the <Location>Bronx<Location>, <Location>Brooklyn<Location> and <Location>Queens<Location>, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in <Location>Manhattan<Location> and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the <Location>Bronx<Location>, 42 percent of those in <Location>Queens<Location> and 31 percent of those in <Location>Brooklyn<Location>. Of last year’s homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in <Location>Manhattan<Location>, 63 percent in the <Location>Bronx<Location>, 62 percent in <Location>Queens<Location>, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in <Location>Brooklyn<Location>. “It’s the culture of the <Organization>Police Department<Organization> that they worry about <Location>Manhattan<Location>,” said <Person>Joseph L. Giacalone<Person>, a former sergeant in the <Location>Bronx<Location> Cold Case Squad, in part “because that’s where the money is. ” He added: “When de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then he’s done the complete opposite of what he said. It’s just business as usual. ” The <Location>Bronx<Location>’s struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the <Location>Bronx<Location> have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the <Location>Bronx<Location> is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass <Location>Brooklyn<Location>’s rate through November as <Location>Bronx<Location> prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said <Organization>Patrice O’Shaughnessy<Organization>, a spokeswoman for the <Location>Bronx<Location> District Attorney’s office. The district attorney, <Organization>Darcel D. Clark<Organization>, elected in 2015, said in a statement, “I was a judge here in the <Location>Bronx<Location>, and I heard from jurors that they can’t be impartial because they don’t trust the police. ” Against that tide of mistrust, <Person>Sergeant LoPuzzo<Person>’s detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered son’s ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization>’s homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapist’s help. Victims’ families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at <Organization>Police Headquarters<Organization>. In a stuffy   squad room, the detectives of the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> detective, <Person>Jeff Meenagh<Person>, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would “get what you deserve. ” The allies <Person>Sergeant LoPuzzo<Person> makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a woman’s son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name  —   about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after <Person>Sergeant LoPuzzo<Person> arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. <Location><Location>New York<Location> City<Location> owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But <Person>James Fernandez<Person>, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid  —   and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisor’s permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandez’s daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, <Person>Ruben Diaz Jr.<Person> and visited a victim’s advocate in the district attorney’s office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissioner’s office. “We went to all proper channels for help,” the note said. “Both precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger. ” “40th and PSA 7 won’t do anything,” he wrote, referring to the local substation. “Please we need to speak to some one with authority. ” The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector <Person>Jerry <Person>O’Sullivan<Person><Person>, and the <Location>Bronx<Location> narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a woman’s apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. “I have no faith in the City of <Location>New York<Location>, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians,” Mr. Fernandez said. “The only thing I know for sure: God, if we’re in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family. ” Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th <Organization>Precinct<Organization> was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. “I’m bending over backward, and nobody’s not even doing anything,” he said. “Why am I going to help you, if you ain’t going to help me?” By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector <Person>O’Sullivan<Person> said. Chief <Person>Boyce<Person> said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. “No one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment,” he said. Mr. Fernandez’s complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away.",
"2","17285","Tyrus Wong, ‘Bambi’ Artist Thwarted by Racial Bias, Dies at 106 - The New York Times","New York Times","Margalit Fox","2017-01-06","2017.0","1.0","","When <Person>Walt <Organization>Disney<Organization><Person>’s “Bambi” opened in 1942, critics praised its spare, haunting visual style, vastly different from anything <Organization>Disney<Organization> had done before. But what they did not know was that the film’s striking appearance had been created by a Chinese immigrant artist, who took as his inspiration the landscape paintings of the Song dynasty. The extent of his contribution to “Bambi,” which remains a   mark for film animation, would not be widely known for decades. Like the film’s title character, the artist, <Person>Tyrus <Person>Wong<Person><Person>, weathered irrevocable separation from his mother  —   and, in the hope of making a life in <Location>America<Location>, incarceration, isolation and rigorous interrogation  —   all when he was still a child. In the years that followed, he endured poverty, discrimination and chronic lack of recognition, not only for his work at <Organization>Disney<Organization> but also for his fine art, before finding acclaim in his 90s. Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> died on Friday at 106. A <Location>Hollywood<Location> studio artist, painter, printmaker, calligrapher,   illustrator and, in later years, maker of fantastical kites, he was one of the most celebrated   artists of the 20th century. But because of the marginalization to which   were long subject, he passed much of his career unknown to the general public. Artistic recognition, when Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> did find it, was all the more noteworthy for the fact that among Chinese immigrant men of his generation, professional prospects were largely limited to menial jobs like houseboy and laundryman. Trained as a painter, Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was a leading figure in the Modernist movement that flourished in <Location>California<Location> between the first and second World Wars. In 1932 and again in 1934, his work was included in group shows at <Organization>the Art Institute of Chicago<Organization> that also featured <Person>Picasso<Person>, <Person>Matisse<Person> and <Person>Paul Klee<Person>. As a staff artist for <Location>Hollywood<Location> studios from the 1930s to the 1960s, he drew storyboards and made vibrant paintings, as detailed as any architectural illustrations, that helped the director envision each scene before it was shot. Over the years his work informed the look of animated pictures for <Organization>Disney<Organization> and   films for <Organization>Warner Brothers<Organization> and other studios, among them “The Sands of Iwo Jima” (1949) “Rebel Without a Cause” (1955) and “The Wild Bunch” (1969). But of the dozens of films on which he worked, it was for “Bambi” that Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was  —   belatedly  —   most renowned. “He was truly involved with every phase of production,” <Person>John <Person>Canemaker<Person><Person>, an   animator and a historian of animation at <Organization>New York University<Organization>, said in an interview for this obituary in March. “He created an art direction that had really never been seen before in animation. ” In 2013 and 2014, Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was the subject of “Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,” a major retrospective at the <Organization>Disney<Organization> Family Museum in <Location>San Francisco<Location>. From the museum’s windows, which overlook <Location>San Francisco<Location> Bay, he could contemplate Angel Island, where more than nine decades earlier, as a lone    he had sought to gain admission to a country that adamantly did not want him. <Person>Wong<Person> <Person>Gen Yeo<Person> (the name is sometimes Romanized <Person>Wong<Person> Gaing Yoo) was born on Oct. 25, 1910, in a farming village in <Location>Guangdong Province<Location>. As a young child, he already exhibited a love of drawing and was encouraged by his father. In 1920, seeking better economic prospects, <Person>Gen Yeo<Person> and his father embarked for <Location>the <Location>United States<Location><Location>, leaving his mother and sister behind. <Person>Gen Yeo<Person> would never see his mother again. They were obliged to travel under false identities  —   a state of affairs known among Chinese immigrants as being a “paper son”  —   in the hope of circumventing the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Signed into law by President <Person>Chester A. Arthur<Person>, the act, which drastically curtailed the number of Chinese people allowed to enter the country, was among the earliest <Location>United States<Location> laws to impose severe restrictions on immigration. But in 1906, an unforeseen loophole opened in the form of the <Location>San Francisco<Location> earthquake and fire. Because a huge number of municipal documents, including birth and immigration records, were destroyed, many newly arrived Chinese capitalized on the loss, maintaining that they had been born in <Location>San Francisco<Location> before the fire. As <Location>United States<Location> citizens, they were entitled to bring over their relatives  —   or, in the case of <Person>Gen Yeo<Person> and his father, “paper sons” posing as relatives. Attuned to the deception, <Location>United States<Location> immigration officials put Chinese arrivals through a formidable inquisition to ensure they were who they claimed to be. The questions came like gunfire: In which direction does your village face? How many windows are in your house? Where in the house is the rice bin? How wide is your well? How deep? Are there trees in your village? Are there lakes? What shops can you name? The sponsoring relative was interrogated separately, and the answers had to match. For the new arrival, a major mistake, or a series of smaller ones, could mean deportation. To stand a chance of passing, aspirants memorized rigorous dossiers known as coaching papers. The ensuing interrogation was hard enough for adults.    <Person>Gen Yeo<Person> would undergo it alone. On Dec. 30, 1920, after a month at sea, the <Person>Wong<Person>s landed at Angel Island Immigration Station. The elder Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was traveling as a merchant named Look Get his son as <Person>Look Tai Yow<Person>. “Angel Island is considered to be the Ellis Island of the West Coast,” Lisa <Person>See<Person>, the author of “On Gold Mountain” (1995) a nonfiction chronicle of her   family, said in an interview in 2016. However, she continued: “The goal was really very different than Ellis Island, which was supposed to be so welcoming. Angel Island opened very specifically to keep the Chinese out. ” Because Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>’s father had previously lived in <Location>the <Location>United States<Location><Location> as Look Get, he was able to clear Immigration quickly. But as a new arrival, <Person>Gen Yeo<Person> was detained on the island for nearly a month, the only child among the immigrants being held there. “I was scared half to death I just cried,” Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> recalled in “Tyrus,” an   documentary directed by <Person>Pamela <Person>Tom<Person><Person>, which premiered in 2015. “Every day is just miserable  —   miserable. I hated that place. ” On Jan. 27, 1921, in the presence of an interpreter and a stenographer, young <Person>Gen Yeo<Person>, posing as <Person>Look Tai Yow<Person>, was interrogated by three inspectors. His father had already been questioned. <Person>Gen Yeo<Person> was well prepared and answered without error. In <Location>Sacramento<Location>, where he joined his father, a schoolteacher <Location>America<Location>nized “Tai Yow” to “Tyrus,” and he was known as <Person>Tyrus <Person>Wong<Person><Person> ever after. Soon afterward, father and son were separated once more, when the elder Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> moved to <Location>Los Angeles<Location> to seek work. For reasons that have been lost to time, he could not take his son. Tyrus lived on his own in a <Location>Sacramento<Location> boardinghouse while attending elementary school. Two years later  —   possibly more  —   Tyrus traveled to <Location>Los Angeles<Location> to join his father, who had found work in a gambling den. They lived in a   boardinghouse sandwiched between a butcher shop and a brothel. After school, Tyrus worked as a houseboy for two <Location>Pasadena<Location> families, earning 50 cents a day. His first art teacher was his father, who trained him nightly in calligraphy by having him dip a brush in water and trace ghostly characters on newspaper: They could not afford ink or drawing paper. When Tyrus was in junior high, a teacher, noting his drawing talent, arranged a summer scholarship to <Organization>the <Organization>Otis<Organization> Art Institute<Organization> in <Location>Los Angeles<Location>. By his own account an indifferent student in public school, Tyrus found his calling at the institute, now <Organization>the <Organization>Otis<Organization> College of Art and Design<Organization>. When his scholarship ended he declined to return to junior high. His father scraped together the $90 tuition  —   a small fortune  —   to let him stay on as <Organization>Otis<Organization>’s youngest student. He studied there for at least five years, simultaneously working as the school janitor, before graduating in the 1930s. Not long afterward his father died, leaving young Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> entirely on his own. From 1936 to 1938, Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was an artist for <Organization>the Works Progress Administration<Organization>, creating paintings for libraries and other public spaces. With friends, including the   artist <Person>Benji <Person>Okubo<Person><Person>, he founded the <Organization>Oriental Artists’ Group<Organization> of <Location>Los Angeles<Location>, which organized exhibitions of members’ work  —   an   level of exposure for Asian artists at the time. Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>, newly married and needing steady work, joined <Organization>Disney<Organization> in 1938 as an “” creating the thousands of intermediate drawings that bring animated sequences to life. Asians were then a novelty at <Location>Hollywood<Location> studios, and Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was made keenly aware of the fact, first at <Organization>Disney<Organization> and later at <Organization>Warner Brothers<Organization>. One   flung a racial epithet at him. Another assumed on sight that he worked in the company cafeteria. Then there was the affront of the  ’s job itself: Painstaking, repetitive and for Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> quickly   it is the   work of animation  —   “a terrible use of his talents as a landscape artist and a painter,” Mr. <Person>Canemaker<Person> said. A reprieve came in the late 1930s, when Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> learned that <Organization>Disney<Organization> was adapting “Bambi, a Life in the Woods,” the 1923 novel by the Austrian writer <Person>Felix<Person> Salten about a fawn whose mother is killed by a hunter. In trying to animate the book, <Organization>Disney<Organization> had reached an impasse. The studio had enjoyed great success in 1937 with its animated film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” a baroque production in which every detail of the backgrounds  —   every petal on every flower, every leaf on every tree  —   was meticulously represented. In an attempt to use a similar style for “Bambi,” it found that the ornate backgrounds camouflaged the deer and other forest creatures on which the narrative centered. Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> spied his chance. “I said, ‘<Person>Gee<Person>, this is all outdoor scenery,’” he recalled in a video interview years afterward, adding: “I said, ‘<Person>Gee<Person>, I’m a landscape painter! ’” Invoking the exquisite landscape paintings of the Song dynasty (<Person>A. D. 960<Person> —  1279) he rendered in watercolors and pastels a series of nature scenes that were moody, lyrical and atmospheric  —   at once lush and spare  —   with backgrounds subtly suggested by a stroke or two of the brush. “<Person>Walt <Organization>Disney<Organization><Person> went crazy over them,” said Mr. <Person>Canemaker<Person>, who wrote about Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> in his book “Before the Animation Begins: The Art and Lives of <Organization>Disney<Organization> Inspirational Sketch Artists” (1996). “He said, ‘I love this indefinite quality, the mysterious quality of the forest. ’” Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was unofficially promoted to the rank of inspirational sketch artist. “But he was more than that,” Mr. <Person>Canemaker<Person> explained. “He was the designer he was the person they went to when they had questions about the color, about how to lay something out. He even influenced the music and the special effects: Just by the look of the drawings, he inspired people. ” Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> spent two years painting the illustrations that would inform every aspect of “Bambi. ” Throughout the finished film  —   lent a brooding quality by its stark landscapes misty, desaturated palette and figures often seen in silhouette  —   his influence is unmistakable. But in 1941, in the wake of a bitter employees’ strike that year, <Organization>Disney<Organization> fired Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>. Though he had chosen not to strike  —   he felt the studio had been good to him, Mr. <Person>Canemaker<Person> said  —   he was let go amid the lingering climate of   resentments. On “Bambi,” Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>’s name appears, quite far down in the credits, as a mere “background” artist. Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> joined <Organization>Warner Brothers<Organization> in 1942, working there  —   and lent out on occasion to other studios  —   until his retirement in 1968. The indignities he endured were not confined to the studios. Trying to buy a house, he and his wife, the former <Person>Ruth Kim<Person>, were told that each property they inquired about had just been sold. “Then in a month you’d go back there and the sign was still there,” Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> recalled in “Tyrus. ” After the Japanese attack on <Person>Pearl Harbor<Person> in December 1941, Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>, like many   took to wearing a lapel button proclaiming his heritage, lest an angry <Location>America<Location>n beat him up on the street. The war permanently dispersed the fledgling <Organization>Oriental Artists’ Group<Organization>. Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>’s friend Mr. <Person>Okubo<Person> was sent, with tens of thousands of other   to an internment camp. “If World War II hadn’t happened when it did, I think these artists, even the   artists, would have more of a name than they do today,” Ms. <Person>See<Person> said. “And that’s because this little movement that had just barely started was split apart by the war. ” Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>, who became a <Location>United States<Location> citizen in 1946, also designed Christmas cards for <Location>Hallmark<Location> and painted elegant   designs on dinnerware, now sought after by collectors. A longtime resident of <Location>Sunland<Location>, <Location>Calif.<Location> he became, in retirement, a renowned kitemaker, designing, building and hand coloring astonishing, airworthy creations  —   butterflies, swallows, whole flocks of owls, centipedes more than 100 feet long  —   that streaked the Southern <Location>California<Location> sky like paint on blue canvas. During the last 15 years of Ruth <Person>Wong<Person>’s life, when she was ill with dementia, Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> forsook his work to care for her. After her death in 1995, he slowly began making art again. In 2001, in formal recognition of his influence on “Bambi,” Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> was named a <Organization>Disney<Organization> Legend. The honor  —   whose previous recipients include <Person>Fred MacMurray<Person>, <Person>Julie Andrews<Person> and <Person>Annette Funicello  <Person>—   is bestowed by the <Person>Walt <Organization>Disney<Organization><Person> Company for outstanding contributions. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, curated in part by Ms. <Person>See<Person>, was the inaugural exhibition at the Chinese <Location>America<Location>n Museum in <Location>Los Angeles<Location>. The <Organization>Disney<Organization> Family Museum’s retrospective, “Water to Paper, Paint to Sky,” traveled in 2015 to <Organization>the Museum of Chinese<Organization> in <Location>America<Location>, in Lower <Location>Manhattan<Location>. Mr. <Person>Wong<Person>’s death, at his home in <Location>Sunland<Location>, was confirmed by the filmmaker Ms. <Person>Tom<Person>. His survivors include three daughters, <Person>Kay Fong<Person>,   <Person>Wong<Person> and Kim <Person>Wong<Person> and two grandchildren. When his daughters were small, Mr. <Person>Wong<Person> encouraged them to make art, as his father had encouraged him. Yet he would not let them have coloring books. The reason was simple: He did not want his children constrained, he said, by lines laid down by others.",

Of all the fields of endeavor that suffered mortal losses in 2016  —   consider <Person>Muhammad <Person>Ali<Person><Person> and <Person>Arnold Palmer<Person> in sports and the      <Location>Hollywood<Location> deaths of <Person>Carrie <Person>Fisher<Person><Person> and <Person>Debbie <Person>Reynolds<Person>  <Person>—   the pop music world had, hands down, the bleakest year. Start with <Person>David Bowie<Person>, whose stage persona  —   androgynous <Person>glam rocker<Person>, dance pop star, electronic experimentalist  —   was as   as his music. The year was only days old when the news came that he had died of cancer at 69. He had hinted that his time was short in the lyrics of his final album, released just two days before his death, but he had otherwise gone to great lengths to hide his illness from the public, a wish for privacy that ensured that his death would appear to have come out of the blue. Then came another shock, about three months later, when Prince accidentally overdosed on a painkiller and collapsed in an elevator at his sprawling home studio near <Location>Minneapolis<Location>. Death came to him at 57, and by all indications no one, including <Person>Prince Rogers Nelson<Person>, had seen it coming. As energetic onstage as ever, holding to an otherwise healthy regimen, he had successfully defied age into his sixth decade, so why not death, too? <Person>Leonard Cohen<Person>, on the other hand, in his 83rd year, undoubtedly did see it coming, just over his shoulder, but he went on his  —   I hesitate to say <Person>merry  <Person>—   way, ever the wise,   troubadour playing to sellout crowds and shrugging at the inevitable, knowing that the dark would finally overtake him but saying essentially, “Until then, here’s another song. ” It was as if 2016 hadn’t delivered enough jolts to the system when it closed out the year with yet another   death. <Person><Person>George<Person> Michael<Person>, the 1980s sensation whose <Organization>aura<Organization> had dimmed in later years, was 53 when he went to bed and never woke up on Christmas. Pop music figures fell all year, many of their voices still embedded in the nicked vinyl grooves of old records that a lot of people can’t bear to throw out. The roster included <Person><Person>Paul<Person> Kantner<Person> of <Person>Jefferson Airplane Keith <Location>Emerson<Location><Person> and <Person>Greg Lake<Person> of <Location>Emerson<Location>, Lake and <Person>Palmer Glenn Frey<Person> of the Eagles and <Person>Maurice White<Person> of Earth, Wind  Fire. <Person>Leon <Person>Russell<Person><Person>, the piano pounder with a <Organization>Delta<Organization> blues wail and a mountain man’s mass of hair, died. So did <Person>Merle Haggard<Person>, rugged country poet of the common man and the   outlaw. He was joined by the bluegrass legend <Person>Ralph Stanley<Person> and the guitar virtuoso who was practically glued to <Person>Elvis’s<Person> swiveling hips in the early days: <Person>Scotty Moore<Person>. And then there was <Person><Person>George<Person> Martin<Person>, whose   genius had such a creative influence on the sounds of <Person>John<Person>, <Person>Paul<Person>, <Person>George<Person> and <Person>Ringo<Person> (and, by extension, on the entire rock era) that he was hailed as the fifth Beatle. If the music stars could fill arenas, so could idols of another stripe: the mighty athletes who left the scene. No figure among them was as towering as <Person>Ali<Person>. Some called him the greatest sports figure of the 20th century, the boxer who combined power, grace and brains in a way the ring had never seen. But he was more than a great athlete. Matters of war, race and religion coursed through his life in a publicly turbulent way. Some people hated him when he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, a decision that cost him his heavyweight title. But more people admired him, even loved him, for his principled stands, his high spirits, his lightning mind, his winking   and, yes, his rhyming motormouth. Until illness closed in, little could contain him, certainly not mere ropes around a ring. Palmer, too, was transformational, golf’s first media star. The gentleman’s game was never quite the same after he began gathering an army on the rolling greenswards and leading a charge, his shirt coming untucked, a cigarette dangling from his lips, his club just that, a weapon, as he pressed the attack. An entire generation of   postwar guys took up the game because of Arnie, and not a few women did, too. He was athletically blessed, magnetically cool, telegenically handsome  —   but he was somehow one of them, too. The same was said of <Person>Gordie Howe<Person>, Mr. <Person>Hockey<Person>, a son of the <Location>Saskatchewan<Location> prairie who tore up the National <Person>Hockey<Person> League, hung up his skates at 52 and died at 88 and of <Person>Ralph Branca<Person>, a trolley car conductor’s son who was a living reminder that one crushing mistake  —   his, the fastball to <Person>Bobby Thomson<Person> that decided the 1951 <Organization>National League<Organization> pennant  —   can sometimes never be lived down. <Person>Pat Summitt<Person>, the coach who elevated women’s basketball, led her <Location>Tennessee<Location> teams to eight championships and won more games than any other college coach, could not defeat Alzheimer’s disease, dying at 64. And within months <Organization>the National Basketball Association<Organization> lost two giants from different eras. <Person>Clyde Lovelette<Person>, an <Location>Olympic<Location>, college and <Person>N. B. A. champion<Person> who transformed the game as one of its first truly big men, was 86 his hardwood heir <Person>Nate Thurmond<Person>, a defensive stalwart who battled <Person>Russell<Person>, <Person>Wilt<Person> and <Organization>Kareem<Organization> in the paint in a   <Organization>Hall of Fame<Organization> career, was 74. Even older, in the baseball ranks, was <Person>Monte Irvin<Person>. When he died at 96, there were few people still around who could remember watching him play, particularly in his prime, in the 1940s, when he was a star on the <Location>Negro<Location> circuit but barred from the   major leagues. He made the <Organization>Hall of Fame<Organization> anyway as a <Location><Location>New York<Location> Giant<Location> and became <Organization>Major League Baseball’s<Organization> first black executive, but when he died, fans pondered again the question that has hung over many an athletic career shackled by discrimination: What if? A different question, in an entirely different sphere, arose after the stunning news that Justice <Person>Antonin Scalia<Person> had died on a hunting trip in <Location>Texas<Location>: What now? In the thick of one of the most consequential <Organization>Supreme Court<Organization> careers of modern times, he left a void in conservative jurisprudence and, more urgently, a vacancy on the bench that has yet to be filled, raising still more questions about what may await the country. Other exits from the public stage returned us to the past. <Person>Nancy Reagan<Person>’s death evoked the 1980s <Organization>White House<Organization>, where   glamour and   West Coast conservatism took up residence on the banks of the <Location>Potomac<Location>. <Person>John<Person> Glenn’s had us thinking again about a   burst of national pride soaring into outer space. The deaths of <Person>Tom Hayden<Person> and <Person>Daniel Berrigan<Person>, avatars of defiance, harked back to the student rebellions of the 1960s and the Vietnam War’s roiling home front. <Person>Phyllis Schlafly<Person>’s obituaries were windows on the roots of the right wing’s ascension in American politics. The death of <Person>Janet Reno<Person>, the first woman to serve as attorney general, recalled the <Person>Clinton<Person> years, all eight of them, from the firestorm at <Location>Waco<Location>, <Location>Tex.<Location> to the international tug of war over a Cuban boy named <Person>Elián González<Person>, to the bitter <Organization>Senate<Organization> battle over impeachment. On other shores, <Person>Fidel Castro<Person>’s death at 90 summoned memories of Cuban revolution, nuclear brinkmanship and enduring enmity between a   strongman and the superpower only 90 miles away. The name of <Location>Boutros<Location>   the Egyptian diplomat who led <Organization>the United Nations<Organization>, led to replayed nightmares of genocide in <Location>Rwanda<Location> and <Location>Bosnia<Location>. The death of <Person>Shimon Peres<Person> removed a last link to the very founding of <Location>Israel<Location> and conjured decades of growing military power and fitful strivings for peace. And that of <Person>Elie Wiesel<Person>, in <Location>New York<Location>, after his tireless struggle to compel the world never to forget, made us confront once again the gas chambers of <Organization>Auschwitz<Organization>. If writers, too, are   even in fiction, then the world is poorer without the literary voices of <Person>Harper Lee<Person>, <Person>Umberto Eco<Person>, <Person>Pat Conroy<Person>, <Person>Jim Harrison<Person>, <Person>Anita Brookner<Person>, <Person>Alvin Toffler<Person>, <Person>Gloria Naylor<Person> and <Person>William Trevor<Person>, not to mention the playwrights <Person>Peter Shaffer<Person>, <Person>Dario Fo<Person> and,   <Person>Edward Albee  <Person>—   all dead in 2016. But just as treasured were those who spun   for our viewing pleasure  —   none more lustily than Ms. <Person>Fisher<Person>, the     Princess <Person>Leia<Person> of the “Star Wars” tales. Just a day later, capping a year of startling deaths, Ms. <Person>Reynolds<Person>, a singing and acting leading lady of an earlier era, died at 84 in the throes of a mother’s grief. Devotees of the “Harry Potter” movies were saddened by the death of <Person>Alan Rickman<Person>, who played the deliciously dour professor <Person>Severus <Organization>Snape<Organization><Person> in that blockbuster franchise but whose career, on both stage and screen, was far richer than many of <Organization>Snape<Organization>’s younger fans may have known. <Person>Zsa Zsa Gabor’s<Person> celebrity, by contrast, outshone a modest acting career. <Person>Gene Wilder<Person> and <Person>Garry Shandling<Person> died in the same year, both having perfected a brand of hilariously neurotic comedy fit for a   culture. And this time <Person>Abe Vigoda<Person>, of the “Godfather” movies and “<Person>Barney Miller<Person>,” actually did die, after having not actually done so years ago when wildly uninformed people spread the word that he had. On the other side of the camera were directors whose vision came to us from all parts: <Person>Jacques Rivette<Person>, the French New Wave auteur, with his   meditations on life and art <Person>Abbas Kiarostami<Person>, the Iranian master, with his searching examinations of ordinary lives <Person>Andrzej Wajda<Person>, a rival to <Person>Ingmar Bergman<Person> and <Person>Akira Kurosawa<Person> in some critics’ eyes, with his haunting tales of <Location>Poland<Location> under the boot first of Nazis and then of Communists. A long roster of television stars of a generation or two ago passed on, images of their younger selves frozen in time: <Person>Noel Neill<Person> (“Adventures of Superman”) <Person>Alan Young<Person> (“Mister Ed”) <Person>Robert Vaughn<Person> (“The Man From U. N. C. L. E. ”) <Person>William Schallert<Person> and <Person>Patty Duke<Person> (father and daughter on “The <Person>Patty Duke<Person> Show”) <Person>Dan Haggerty<Person> (“The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams”) <Person>Florence Henderson<Person> (“The Brady Bunch”) and <Person>Alan Thicke<Person> (“Growing Pains”). And <Person>Garry Marshall<Person>, the creative force who practically owned prime time with “Happy Days,” “Mork  Mindy,” “Laverne  Shirley” and more, died at 81. On Broadway, lights were dimmed in memory of <Person>Brian Bedford<Person>, <Person>Tammy Grimes<Person> and <Person>Anne Jackson<Person>, all brilliant in their day. The architect <Person>Zaha Hadid<Person> left behind monuments to her fertile imagination and shaken acolytes around the world. The street photographer <Person>Bill Cunningham<Person>, who found fashion statements on every corner, was suddenly missing, making <Location>Manhattan<Location>, overnight, a less idiosyncratic, less interesting place. That smiling skinny man pedaling his bicycle among the honking cabs in a blue French worker’s jacket with a camera slung around his neck  —   what a picture!  —   had split from the scene. So had seemingly a generation of fellow photographers who had made art in recording the last half of the 20th century: <Person>Ruth Gruber<Person>, <Person>Marc Riboud<Person>, <Person>Louis Stettner<Person> and more. And so had the TV journalists <Person>Morley Safer<Person> and <Person>Gwen Ifill<Person> and the TV commentator <Person>John<Person> McLaughlin, all of whom had tried to make sense of it. Music’s other precincts were emptier without the conductor and revolutionary composer <Person>Pierre Boulez<Person> and the new music soprano <Person>Phyllis Curtin<Person> the jazz artists <Person>Mose Allison<Person>, <Person>Bobby Hutcherson<Person> and <Person>Gato Barbieri<Person> the rapper <Person>Phife Dawg<Person> (<Person>Malik Taylor<Person>) and the Latin megastar <Person>Juan Gabriel<Person>. Silicon Valley saw a giant depart in <Person>Andrew S. Grove<Person>, who led the semiconductor revolution at <Organization>Intel<Organization>. The television industry lost a   executive, <Person>Grant Tinker<Person>, who in the ’80s made <Organization>NBC<Organization> the network to watch in prime time. Astrophysics, and the smaller world of women in science, said farewell to a pioneer and a champion in <Person>Vera Rubin<Person>. And for tens of thousands of people who might have choked to death had they not been saved by his simple but ingenious maneuver, the passing of <Person>Henry J. Heimlich<Person> prompted not just sympathy but, even more, gratitude. Come to think of it, eliciting a large, if silent, thank you from those who live on is not a bad way for anyone to go. Which brings us to <Organization>Marion Pritchard<Organization>. Few who died in 2016 could have inspired measures of gratitude more profound. She was a brave young Dutch student and a   gentile who risked her life to save Jews from death camps in the early 1940s, in one instance shooting a Nazi stooge before he could seize three little children she had been hiding. By her estimate she saved 150 people. How many were still alive when she died a few weeks ago at 96 is anyone’s guess. But we know for certain that some were, and we can reasonably surmise that a good many more were, too, all of them still in possession of her selfless gift and her matchless legacy, their very lives.",

Although <Location>North Korea<Location> has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone, and although it habitually threatens to attack <Location>the United States<Location> with nuclear weapons, the country has never   an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. In his annual New Year’s Day speech, which was broadcast on the <Location>North’s<Location>   <Location>KCTV<Location> on Sunday, Mr. <Person>Kim<Person> spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. He said <Location>North Korea<Location> would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as <Location>the United States<Location> remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with <Location>South Korea<Location>. “We have reached the final stage in preparations to   an intercontinental ballistic rocket,” he said.

Mr. <Person>Kim<Person>’s speech on Sunday indicated that <Location>North Korea<Location> may   a   rocket several times this year to complete its ICBM program, said <Person>Cheong<Person>   a senior research fellow at <Organization>the Sejong Institute<Organization> in <Location>South Korea<Location>. The first of such tests could come even before Mr. <Person>Trump<Person>’s inauguration, Mr. <Person>Cheong<Person> said. “We need to take note of the fact that this is the first New Year’s speech where <Person>Kim<Person>   mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile,” he said. In his speech, Mr. <Person>Kim<Person> did not comment on Mr. <Person>Trump<Person>’s election. Doubt still runs deep that <Location>North Korea<Location> has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable ICBM. But analysts in the region said the <Location>North’s<Location> launchings of   rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles. After the <Location>North’s<Location> satellite launch in February, <Location>South Korea<Location>n defense officials said the <Organization>Unha<Organization> rocket used in the launch, if successfully reconfigured as a missile, could fly more than 7, 400 miles with a warhead of 1, 100 to 1, 300 pounds  —   far enough to reach most of <Location>the United States<Location>. <Location>North Korea<Location> has deployed Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of <Location>South Korea<Location> and <Location>Japan<Location>, but it has had a spotty record in   the <Organization>Musudan<Organization>, its   ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on <Location>Guam<Location>. The North has also claimed a series of successes in testing various ICBM technologies, although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region. It has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile. It also claimed success in testing the   technology that allows a   missile to return to the Earth’s atmosphere without breaking up. In April, <Location>North Korea<Location> reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile. At the time, Mr. <Person>Kim<Person> said the North “can tip   intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the Earth, including the U. S. mainland, within our striking range. ” On Sept. 9, the North conducted its fifth, and most powerful, nuclear test. Mr. <Person>Kim<Person> later attended another ground test of a new   rocket engine, exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible. In November, <Organization>the United Nations Security Council<Organization> imposed new  sanctions against the North.",

Tensions between <Location>Taiwan<Location> and <Location>China<Location>, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. <Person>Tsai<Person> spoke on the phone with the American   <Person>Donald J. <Person>Trump<Person><Person>, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice. In recent weeks, <Location>China<Location> has stepped up military activities near <Location>Taiwan<Location>, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, <Location>Beijing<Location> announced that <Organization>São Tomé<Organization> and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of <Location>Taiwan<Location>’s fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in <Location>Taiwan<Location>. Despite <Location>Beijing<Location>’s recent actions, which she said had “hurt the feelings” of the <Location>Taiwan<Location>ese people and destabilized relations, Ms. <Person>Tsai<Person> vowed to avoid a confrontation. “We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,” she said. Ms. <Person>Tsai<Person> faces the delicate task of registering discontent with <Location>Beijing<Location> while also sending a message that <Location>Taiwan<Location> will exercise restraint. <Location>The United States<Location>, which sees <Location>Taiwan<Location> as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides.

Still, Ms. <Person>Tsai<Person>, whose <Organization>Democratic Progressive Party<Organization> has traditionally favored independence for <Location>Taiwan<Location>, could face serious challenges in the coming months. Many people in <Location>Taiwan<Location> are nervous that Mr. <Person>Trump<Person> will use the island as a bargaining chip against <Location>China<Location>.

"7","17290","After ‘The Biggest Loser,’ Their Bodies Fought to Regain Weight - The New York Times","New York Times","Gina Kolata","2017-02-08","2017.0","2.0","","<Person>Danny <Person>Cahill<Person><Person> stood, slightly dazed, in a blizzard of confetti as the audience screamed and his family ran on stage. He had won Season 8 of <Organization>NBC<Organization>’s reality television show “The Biggest Loser,” shedding more weight than anyone ever had on the program  —   an astonishing 239 pounds in seven months. When he got on the scale for all to see that evening, Dec. 8, 2009, he weighed just 191 pounds, down from 430. Dressed in a   and   shorts, he was lean, athletic and as handsome as a model. “I’ve got my life back,” he declared. “I mean, I feel like a million bucks. ” Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> left the show’s stage in <Location>Hollywood<Location> and flew directly to <Location>New York<Location> to start a triumphal tour of the talk shows, chatting with <Person>Jay Leno<Person>, <Person>Regis Philbin<Person> and <Person>Joy Behar<Person>. As he heard from fans all over the world, his elation knew no bounds. But in the years since, more than 100 pounds have crept back onto his    frame despite his best efforts. In fact, most of that season’s 16 contestants have regained much if not all the weight they lost so arduously. Some are even heavier now. Yet their experiences, while a bitter personal disappointment, have been a gift to science. A study of Season 8’s contestants has yielded surprising new discoveries about the physiology of obesity that help explain why so many people struggle unsuccessfully to keep off the weight they lose. <Person>Kevin <Person>Hall<Person><Person>, a scientist at a federal research center who admits to a weakness for reality TV, had the idea to follow the “Biggest Loser” contestants for six years after that victorious night. The project was the first to measure what happened to people over as long as six years after they had lost large amounts of weight with intensive dieting and exercise. The results, the researchers said, were stunning. They showed just how hard the body fights back against weight loss. “It is frightening and amazing,” said Dr. <Person>Hall<Person>, an expert on metabolism at <Organization>the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases<Organization>, which is part of <Organization>the National Institutes of Health<Organization>. “I am just blown away. ” It has to do with resting metabolism, which determines how many calories a person burns when at rest. When the show began, the contestants, though hugely overweight, had normal metabolisms for their size, meaning they were burning a normal number of calories for people of their weight. When it ended, their metabolisms had slowed radically and their bodies were not burning enough calories to maintain their thinner sizes. Researchers knew that just about anyone who deliberately loses weight  —   even if they start at a normal weight or even underweight  —   will have a slower metabolism when the diet ends. So they were not surprised to see that “The Biggest Loser” contestants had slow metabolisms when the show ended. What shocked the researchers was what happened next: As the years went by and the numbers on the scale climbed, the contestants’ metabolisms did not recover. They became even slower, and the pounds kept piling on. It was as if their bodies were intensifying their effort to pull the contestants back to their original weight. Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> was one of the worst off. As he regained more than 100 pounds, his metabolism slowed so much that, just to maintain his current weight of 295 pounds, he now has to eat 800 calories a day less than a typical man his size. Anything more turns to fat. The struggles the contestants went through help explain why it has been so hard to make headway against the nation’s obesity problem, which afflicts more than a third of American adults. Despite spending billions of dollars on   drugs and dieting programs, even the most motivated are working against their own biology. Their experience shows that the body will fight back for years. And that, said Dr. <Person>Michael <Person>Schwartz<Person><Person>, an obesity and diabetes researcher who is a professor of medicine at <Organization>the University of Washington<Organization>, is “new and important. ” “The key point is that you can be on TV, you can lose enormous amounts of weight, you can go on for six years, but you can’t get away from a basic biological reality,” said Dr. <Person>Schwartz<Person>, who was not involved in the study. “As long as you are below your initial weight, your body is going to try to get you back. ” The show’s doctor, <Person>Robert Huizenga<Person>, says he expected the contestants’ metabolic rates to fall just after the show, but was hoping for a smaller drop. He questioned, though, whether the measurements six years later were accurate. But maintaining weight loss is difficult, he said, which is why he tells contestants that they should exercise at least nine hours a week and monitor their diets to keep the weight off. “Unfortunately, many contestants are unable to find or afford adequate ongoing support with exercise doctors, psychologists, sleep specialists, and trainers  —   and that’s something we all need to work hard to change,” he said in an email. The study’s findings, to be published on Monday in the journal <Organization>Obesity<Organization>, are part of a scientific push to answer some of the most fundamental questions about obesity. Researchers are figuring out why being fat makes so many people develop diabetes and other medical conditions, and they are searching for new ways to block the poison in fat. They are starting to unravel the reasons bariatric surgery allows most people to lose significant amounts of weight when dieting so often fails. And they are looking afresh at medical care for obese people. The hope is that this work will eventually lead to new therapies that treat obesity as a chronic disease and can help keep weight under control for life. Most people who have tried to lose weight know how hard it is to keep the weight off, but many blame themselves when the pounds come back. But what obesity research has consistently shown is that dieters are at the mercy of their own bodies, which muster hormones and an altered metabolic rate to pull them back to their old weights, whether that is hundreds of pounds more or that extra 10 or 15 that many people are trying to keep off. There is always a weight a person’s body maintains without any effort. And while it is not known why that weight can change over the years  —   it may be an effect of aging  —   at any point, there is a weight that is easy to maintain, and that is the weight the body fights to defend. Finding a way to thwart these mechanisms is the goal scientists are striving for. First, though, they are trying to understand them in greater detail. Dr. <Person>David <Person>Ludwig<Person><Person>, the director of the New Balance Foundation <Organization>Obesity<Organization> Prevention Center at <Organization>Boston Children’s Hospital<Organization>, who was not involved in the research, said the findings showed the need for new approaches to weight control. He cautioned that the study was limited by its small size and the lack of a control group of obese people who did not lose weight. But, he added, the findings made sense. “This is a subset of the most successful” dieters, he said. “If they don’t show a return to normal in metabolism, what hope is there for the rest of us?” Still, he added, “that shouldn’t be interpreted to mean we are doomed to battle our biology or remain fat. It means we need to explore other approaches. ” Some scientists say weight maintenance has to be treated as an issue separate from weight loss. Only when that challenge is solved, they say, can progress truly be made against obesity. “There is a lot of basic research we still need to do,” said Dr. <Person>Margaret Jackson<Person>, who is directing a project at <Person>Pfizer<Person>. Her group is testing a drug that, in animals at least, acts like leptin, a hormone that controls hunger. With weight loss, leptin levels fall and people become hungry. The idea is to trick the brains of people who have lost weight so they do not become ravenous for lack of leptin. While many of the contestants kept enough weight off to improve their health and became more physically active, the low weights they strived to keep eluded all but one of them: <Person>Erinn <Person>Egbert<Person><Person>, a   caregiver for her mother in <Location>Versailles<Location>, <Location>Ky.<Location> And she struggles mightily to keep the pounds off because her metabolism burns 552 fewer calories a day than would be expected for someone her size. “What people don’t understand is that a treat is like a drug,” said Ms. <Person>Egbert<Person>, who went from 263 pounds to just under 176 on the show, and now weighs between 152 and 157. “Two treats can turn into a binge over a   period. That is what I struggle with. ” Six years after Season 8 ended, 14 of the 16 contestants went to <Person>the N. I. H.<Person> last fall for three days of testing. The researchers were concerned that the contestants might try to frantically lose weight before coming in, so they shipped equipment to them that would measure their physical activity and weight before their visit, and had the information sent remotely to <Person>the N. I. H.<Person> The contestants received their metabolic results last week. They were shocked, but on further reflection, decided the numbers explained a lot. “All my friends were drinking beer and not gaining massive amounts of weight,” Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> said. “The moment I started drinking beer, there goes another 20 pounds. I said, ‘This is not right. Something is wrong with my body. ’” <Person>Sean Algaier<Person>, 36, a pastor from <Location>Charlotte<Location>, <Person>N. C.<Person> feels cheated. He went from 444 pounds to 289 as a contestant on the show. Now his weight is up to 450 again, and he is burning 458 fewer calories a day than would be expected for a man his size. “It’s kind of like hearing you have a life sentence,” he said. Slower metabolisms were not the only reason the contestants regained weight, though. They constantly battled hunger, cravings and binges. The investigators found at least one reason: plummeting levels of leptin. The contestants started out with normal levels of leptin. By the season’s finale, they had almost no leptin at all, which would have made them ravenous all the time. As their weight returned, their leptin levels drifted up again, but only to about half of what they had been when the season began, the researchers found, thus helping to explain their urges to eat. <Person>Leptin<Person> is just one of a cluster of hormones that control hunger, and although Dr. <Person>Hall<Person> and his colleagues did not measure the rest of them, another group of researchers, in a different project, did. In a   study funded by <Location>Australia<Location>’s <Organization>National Health and Medical Research Council<Organization>, Dr. <Person>Joseph <Person>Proietto<Person><Person> of <Organization>the University of Melbourne<Organization> and his colleagues recruited 50 overweight people who agreed to consume just 550 calories a day for eight or nine weeks. They lost an average of nearly 30 pounds, but over the next year, the pounds started coming back. Dr. <Person>Proietto<Person> and his colleagues looked at leptin and four other hormones that satiate people. Levels of most of them fell in their study subjects. They also looked at a hormone that makes people want to eat. Its level rose. “What was surprising was what a coordinated effect it is,” Dr. <Person>Proietto<Person> said. “The body puts multiple mechanisms in place to get you back to your weight. The only way to maintain weight loss is to be hungry all the time. We desperately need agents that will suppress hunger and that are safe with   use. ” Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person>, 46, said his weight problem began when he was in the third grade. He got fat, then fatter. He would starve himself, and then eat a whole can of cake frosting with a spoon. Afterward, he would cower in the pantry off the kitchen, feeling overwhelmed with shame. Over the years, his insatiable urge to eat kept overcoming him, and his weight climbed: 370 pounds, 400, 460, 485. “I used to look at myself and think, ‘I am horrible, I am a monster, subhuman,’” he said. He began sleeping in a recliner because he was too heavy to sleep lying down. Walking hurt stairs were agony. Buying clothes with a 68 waist was humiliating. “I remember sitting in a dressing room one day, and nothing would fit. I looked at the traffic outside on the street and thought, ‘I should just run out in front of a car. ’” He eventually seized on “The Biggest Loser” as his best chance to lose enough weight to live a normal life. He tried three times and was finally selected. Before the show began, the contestants underwent medical tests to be sure they could endure the rigorous schedule that lay ahead. And rigorous it was. Sequestered on the “Biggest Loser” ranch with the other contestants, Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> exercised seven hours a day, burning 8, 000 to 9, 000 calories according to a calorie tracker the show gave him. He took electrolyte tablets to help replace the salts he lost through sweating, consuming many fewer calories than before. Eventually, he and the others were sent home for four months to try to keep losing weight on their own. Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> set a goal of a   deficit per day. The idea was to lose a pound a day. He quit his job as a land surveyor to do it. His routine went like this: Wake up at 5 a. m. and run on a treadmill for 45 minutes. Have breakfast  —   typically one egg and two egg whites, half a grapefruit and a piece of sprouted grain toast. Run on the treadmill for another 45 minutes. Rest for 40 minutes bike ride nine miles to a gym. Work out for two and a half hours. Shower, ride home, eat lunch  —   typically a grilled skinless chicken breast, a cup of broccoli and 10 spears of asparagus. Rest for an hour. Drive to the gym for another round of exercise. If he had not burned enough calories to hit his goal, he went back to the gym after dinner to work out some more. At times, he found himself running around his neighborhood in the dark until his   indicator reset to zero at midnight. On the day of the   on the show’s finale, Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> and the others dressed carefully to hide the rolls of loose skin that remained, to their surprise and horror, after they had lost weight. They wore compression undergarments to hold it in. Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> knew he could not maintain his finale weight of 191 pounds. He was so mentally and physically exhausted he barely moved for two weeks after his publicity tour ended. But he had started a new career giving motivational speeches as the biggest loser ever, and for the next four years, he managed to keep his weight below 255 pounds by exercising two to three hours a day. But two years ago, he went back to his job as a surveyor, and the pounds started coming back. Soon the scale hit 265. Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> started weighing and measuring his food again and stepped up his exercise. He got back down to 235 to 240 pounds. But his weight edged up again, to 275, then 295. His slow metabolism is part of the problem, and so are his food cravings. He opens a bag of chips, thinking he will have just a few. “I’d eat five bites. Then I’d black out and eat the whole bag of chips and say, ‘What did I do? ’” Dr. <Person>Lee Kaplan<Person>, an obesity researcher at <Organization>Harvard<Organization>, says the brain sets the number of calories we consume, and it can be easy for people to miss that how much they eat matters less than the fact that their bodies want to hold on to more of those calories. Dr. <Person>Michael <Person>Rosenbaum<Person><Person>, an obesity researcher at <Organization>Columbia University<Organization> who has collaborated with Dr. <Person>Hall<Person> in previous studies, said the body’s systems for regulating how many calories are consumed and how many are burned are tightly coupled when people are not strenuously trying to lose weight or to maintain a significant weight loss. Still, pounds can insidiously creep on. “We eat about 900, 000 to a million calories a year, and burn them all except those annoying 3, 000 to 5, 000 calories that result in an average annual weight gain of about one to two pounds,” he said. “These very small differences between intake and output average out to only about 10 to 20 calories per day  —   less than one Starburst candy  —   but the cumulative consequences over time can be devastating. ” “It is not clear whether this small imbalance and the resultant weight gain that most of us experience as we age are the consequences of changes in lifestyle, the environment or just the biology of aging,” Dr. <Person>Rosenbaum<Person> added. The effects of small imbalances between calories eaten and calories burned are more pronounced when people deliberately lose weight, Dr. <Person>Hall<Person> said. Yes, there are signals to regain weight, but he wondered how many extra calories people were driven to eat. He found a way to figure that out. He analyzed data from a clinical trial in which people took a diabetes drug, canagliflozin, that makes them spill 360 calories a day into their urine, or took a placebo. The drug has no known effect on the brain, and the person does not realize those calories are being spilled. Those taking the drug gradually lost weight. But for every five pounds they lost, they were, without realizing it, eating an additional 200 calories a day. Those extra calories, Dr. <Person>Hall<Person> said, were a bigger driver of weight regained than the slowing of the metabolism. And, he added, if people fought the urge to eat those calories, they would be hungry. “Unless they continue to fight it constantly, they will regain the weight,” he said. All this does not mean that modest weight loss is hopeless, experts say. Individuals respond differently to diet manipulations  —     or   diets, for example  —   and to exercise and   drugs, among other interventions. But Dr. <Person>Ludwig<Person> said that simply cutting calories was not the answer. “There are no doubt exceptional individuals who can ignore primal biological signals and maintain weight loss for the long term by restricting calories,” he said, but he added that “for most people, the combination of incessant hunger and slowing metabolism is a recipe for weight regain  —   explaining why so few individuals can maintain weight loss for more than a few months. ” Dr. <Person>Rosenbaum<Person> agreed. “The difficulty in keeping weight off reflects biology, not a pathological lack of willpower affecting   of <Organization>the U. S. A.<Organization> ,” he said. Mr. <Person>Cahill<Person> knows that now. And with his report from Dr. <Person>Hall<Person>’s group showing just how much his metabolism had slowed, he stopped blaming himself for his weight gain. “That shame that was on my shoulders went off,” he said.",

Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> happens to be a friend of <Person>Ben Schneider<Person>, the band’s lead singer, and had an extra ticket. “This was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are,” Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> said. He and Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> met up at the show. That is when Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> and Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> moved into the ambiguous “mixtape era,” in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy “are we just friends or what” texts revolving around music. For example, Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> was visiting <Location>New York<Location> and texted Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> a request for “walking around SoHo music. ” He sent her a link to “Love Me Again,” by <Person><Person>John<Person> Newman<Person>. It has a club vibe but romantic lyrics. “I wanted to read into it,” Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> said, but she figured (correctly, it turns out) that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn’t spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her. Another time he emailed her a link to a <Organization>Fleetwood Mac<Organization> version of “Need Your Love So Bad. ” After listening to it, Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> said, “I called my friend <Person>Katie<Person>. ” “At that time,” she continued, “I just referred to him as ‘the supervisor.’ She knew I had a crush on him. She said, ‘How can it not mean something? ’” Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> a message with this song. “I sort of thought, ‘Maybe it’s too much. ’” But he shared it with her anyway. (This is the same man who sent her the song “BedBedBedBedBed, <Person>Vacationer Remix<Person>,” by <Organization>Deleted Scenes<Organization>, “during the friend phase,” Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> said.) Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> played the game, too. She made Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> a mix CD (handwritten liner notes and all) that she titled “<Organization>Feynman<Organization> Diagrams for All,” after Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of <Organization>Feynman<Organization> diagrams  —   in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles  —   was romantic. On the mix, Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> included <Organization>the Mazzy Star<Organization> song “I’ve Been Let Down. ” It was “a bit of an Easter egg of my actual feelings,” she said. Around this time, Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> texted Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> a photo of the drink menu from a bar,  the <Person>Roger Room<Person>. She had focused on a drink named for the song “Christmas Card From a Hooker in <Location>Minneapolis<Location>,” which happens to be Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person>’s favorite <Person>Tom Waits<Person> tune. “This made me rethink things a bit,” he said, adding, “<Person><Person>Hillary<Person> <Person>Kerr<Person><Person> was clearly not to be trifled with. ” In early 2014, Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> invited her to a <Organization>Bleachers<Organization> concert. The band’s lead singer is <Person>Jack Antonoff<Person>, who is Ms. <Person>Dunham<Person>’s boyfriend. Ms. <Person>Dunham<Person> was at the concert as well, and on meeting Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person>, she said, “I’ve heard so much about you. ” Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> and Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> shared their first kiss that night. He proposed to her on <Location>Polihale Beach<Location> in <Location>Kauai<Location>, <Location>Hawaii<Location>, on Jan. 1, 2016. On Dec. 10, 125 friends and relatives gathered in <Location>Palm Springs<Location>, <Location>Calif.<Location> at <Organization>the Colony Palms Hotel<Organization>, which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster <Person>Al Wertheimer<Person> and whose poolside guests have included <Person>Frank Sinatra<Person>, <Person>Ronald Reagan<Person>, <Person>Kirk Douglas<Person> and <Person>Zsa Zsa Gabor<Person>. Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> walked down a grassy aisle in a   courtyard wearing a structured lace Reem Acra dress, strapless with a bustier and a full skirt. Four musicians played “Once, With Feeling,” an instrumental song Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> wrote for Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person>. . Just minutes into the cocktail reception, a few of Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person>’s best friends descended upon her. <Person>Jen Atkin<Person>, the celebrity hairstylist and social media star, started fussing with the flower she had sewn into the bride’s hair. <Person>Joey Maalouf<Person>, the celebrity makeup artist who is a creator of the       service the <Person>Glam App<Person>, whipped out a tube of lip gloss and reapplied it to the bride’s pucker. He had done her makeup. “The look we went for is sickeningly stunning and perfect,” he said. Guests mingled over drinks by the pool, which was framed by banquette tables lit from above by strings of bulbs. The sky turned pink before the stars appeared, and guests snapped photos and shared them with the hundreds of thousands who follow these members of the   illuminati (#imwithkerr and #letsgetleahyed). “This looks like it’s art directed,” <Person>Eva Chen<Person>, the head of fashion partnerships for <Organization>Instagram<Organization>, said as she took it all in. She had worked as an assistant at <Organization>Elle<Organization> with Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person>. Friends of both the bride and the groom celebrated what they saw as a great match, based on passion not only for each other but also for music. <Person>Leigh Belz <Person>Ray<Person><Person>, the features and news director at <Organization>InStyle<Organization>, was another former <Organization>Elle<Organization> colleague who made the trip. “<Person>Hillary<Person> loves music, and it’s not just a casual thing,” Ms. <Person>Ray<Person> said. “We used to say the ultimate fantasy was to become a music director, and now she’s married to one. ” After a romantic first dance to <Person>Solomon Burke<Person>’s “If You Need Me,” Mr. and Mrs. <Person>Leahy<Person> (she will use her maiden name professionally) settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a D. J. And before they left for their <Location>Hawaii<Location>an honeymoon, Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> completed his first important act as husband. He pulled together many of the songs that could be considered the soundtrack to their romance and made his wife a mixtape. When Dec. 10, 2016 Where Colony Palms Hotel, <Location>Palm Springs<Location>, <Location>Calif.<Location> <Person>Flora<Person> The bride and groom were married under a white birch trellis, because white birch is the state tree of <Location>New Hampshire<Location>, where Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person> grew up and where his parents, <Person>Richard<Person> and Marie <Person>Leahy<Person>, reside. The structure was wrapped in white peonies, <Location>Sahara<Location> roses and camellia greens. Readings Mr. <Person>Leahy<Person>’s family is <Organization>Roman Catholic<Organization> Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person>’s parents, <Person>John<Person> and Carole <Person>Kerr<Person>, are more spiritual than religiously observant. Many of the guests had an artistic bent. The bride and groom planned accordingly. <Person>Marshall Goldsmith<Person>, an executive coach, author and lifelong family friend of Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person>, officiated. Friends and relatives stood to read poems from <Person>James Kavanaugh<Person> and <Person>Mary<Person> Oliver, as well as a passage from <Organization>the Supreme Court’s<Organization> 2015 ruling legalizing   marriage. “A little Catholic priest, a little lesbian <Person>Pulitzer Prize<Person> winner, a little equal rights for all,” Ms. <Person>Kerr<Person> explained after the ceremony.",
"9","17292","Calling on Angels While Enduring the Trials of Job - The New York Times","New York Times","Andy Newman","2016-12-31","2016.0","12.0","","Angels are everywhere in the <Person>Muñiz<Person> family’s apartment in the <Location>Bronx<Location>: paintings of angels on the wall, ceramic angels flanking the ancient VCR, angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves. As <Person>José<Person> and <Location>Zoraida<Location> <Person>Muñiz<Person> and their children have struggled to deal with a   series of trials and setbacks, including cancer, debilitating epilepsy, deep depression and near eviction, it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together. <Location>Zoraida<Location>’s early life in <Location>Puerto Rico<Location> was like something from a tropical <Person>Dickens<Person> novel. She and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children’s father withdrew support. Then <Location>Zoraida<Location>’s grandfather  —   the father of her absent father  —   destroyed the house in a rage. She was barely a teenager when she met <Person>José<Person>, a Vietnam War veteran. With permission from her uncle, a judge, they were married. She was 14. He was 29. They moved to <Location>New York<Location> in 1983 and started a new life. He built boilers. She worked in construction, using skills she learned as a child, and in a clothing store. But in 1987, Mr. <Person>Muñiz<Person> began having violent seizures  —   eight or 10 a day. They did not respond to medication. He could no longer work. She stopped working to take care of him. Still determined to live something like a normal life, they started a family. Their first child, <Person>José<Person> Jr. had a heart defect. By the time he was 2 he had had six   operations. That’s where the angels came in  —   the first one was a painting, a gift from a cousin.  “When they operated on my son, they told me he was an angel, because he was supposed to die,” Ms. <Person>Muñiz<Person>, 50, said. “From there I figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family. ” All the angels are gifts from friends and relatives, or picked up off the street, just like all the furniture in the <Person>Muñiz<Person>es’ overstuffed apartment in a   complex on Westchester Avenue in the <Location>Bronx<Location>, much of it restored by Ms. <Person>Muñiz<Person>. “So many people throw away things, so I don’t have to buy,” she said. A second son, <Person>Jesus<Person>, became epileptic at 3. A girl, <Person>Maria<Person>, completed the family. In 2007, Mr. <Person>Muñiz<Person> had what felt like a horrible, stubborn toothache. It turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw. Ms. <Person>Muñiz<Person> stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment. “I’m willing to take anything with him,” she said. “I never left him alone, and I never will. ” Radiation did not work. To save Mr. <Person>Muñiz<Person>’s life, surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus. Disfigured, depressed and unable to speak, he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs   care. This is the household where the <Person>Muñiz<Person> children grew up. “We’ve been through every craziness,” said <Person>José<Person> Jr. 24, who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment, “every up and down. ” For years at a time, the family held on, seemingly by a thread. Over the summer, the younger son, <Person>Jesus<Person>, 22, got a   job at a Zaro’s Bakery in <Location>Manhattan<Location>’s financial district. Because the family’s rent is tied to income, the rent tripled in August, to about $770 a month from $245. But <Person>Jesus<Person> had school bills to pay, and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for <Person>José<Person> Sr. ’s mother, who died over the summer, and things began to unravel. They fell behind on the rent and utilities. Food was often scarce. The family regularly skipped meals. It was around this time that Ms. <Person>Muñiz<Person> got in touch with <Organization>Catholic Charities Archdiocese<Organization> of <Location>New York<Location>, one of the eight organizations supported by The <Location>New York<Location> Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. It covered their back rent, got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time. And with $600 from <Organization>the Neediest Cases Fund<Organization>, the family paid its electric bill. Things are looking up in some ways. <Person>Jesus<Person> is returning to college, where he is on a   track and wants to be a paramedic. <Person>Maria<Person> graduated in December from a   nursing program. Thinking of her father and his illness, she wants to be an oncologist. <Person>José<Person> Jr. was just accepted to the <Location>New York<Location> Film Academy’s photography program. But <Person>José<Person> Sr. continues to battle cancer. <Location>Zoraida<Location> is severely depressed. What keeps her going? she was asked. She gestured toward her family, sitting beside her beneath the painted angels. “They give me my strength, even if I have times I collapse,” she said. <Person>José<Person> Jr. agreed. “I use my parents and siblings as my motivation,” he said. “We’re all there for each other,” Ms. <Person>Muñiz<Person> said.",
